I began this project in December 2022, and work on it slowly a few times per week. 
The game features a point based character creation system, a turn based combat system based on your experience level and points in each skill. 
My goal with this project was to create it in such a way that allows for inheritance and polymorphism.

Run the batch file and it should open in console.
Make sure you have Java 19 installed!
